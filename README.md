### I'm Matt (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a Software Developer with a focus on the front end. I've previously worked on startups and at a digital agency, and I'm currently working [@Wealthsimple](https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/) on a product team
- Most of my time is spent in TypeScript & React Native, but I like to experiment in other languages and frameworks like Python and Ruby
- Outside of development, I weightlift, golf, snowboard, and do a lot of PC gaming
